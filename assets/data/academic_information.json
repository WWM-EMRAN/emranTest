This project is about finding relationship between sleep pattern and different health status (healthy or have sleep disorders) using a simpler physiological signal called Hypnogram for assistive diagnostic. Starting from traditional ML and ensemble ML to advanced models such as traditional DL, CNN, RNN, graph neural networks (GNN), are applied to analyse the feasibility of a wearable sleep monitoring system.

My research focused on the intersection of biomedical engineering and Machine Learning (ML), specifically addressing the challenge of EEG channel reduction for seizure detection. By applying advanced signal processing and optimization techniques, the project aimed to improve the feasibility of long-term patient monitoring. The program involved significant technical development within the School of Information Technology (SIT) and required navigating complex biomedical datasets. The culmination of this research was a comprehensive thesis exceeding 50,000 words, successfully defended and awarded in late 2022.",
